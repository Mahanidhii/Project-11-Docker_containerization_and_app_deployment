# Docker Installation and Container Deployment

### Description
We will see how to install and setup Docker Desktop application and run our first container

### Steps:
1. Install Docker Desktop from the web
2. Open the Docker Dekstop once the installation process is over
3. If there are any errors in the opening of the app, open command prompt and update your wsl (websystem for linux) using the command `wsl --update`
4. Now follow the in-app tutorial for creating your first container on Docker
5. Click on the newly created container. This should open up a "congratulations" page in your browser.
